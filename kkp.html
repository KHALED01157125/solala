            <h2>The fall of the house of ausher</h2>
            <h4>
    

The story starts with a guy (we don't know his name) getting a letter from his friend, Roderick Usher. Roderick says he's really sick and needs his help. So, the guy travels to Roderick's old and spooky house, which is in a dreary, desolate place.

When he gets there, he sees that the house is falling apart. It's like it's dying, just like Roderick and his sister, Madeline. Roderick is super scared and nervous all the time. He says he's got these heightened senses and can't stand light, sound, or certain smells.

Madeline is sick too. She spends most of her time in bed and hardly talks. She seems like she's fading away.

The guy tries to cheer Roderick up by reading and playing music with him. But things just keep getting weirder. Roderick starts hearing strange noises, like groans and whispers. And the house itself seems alive, with its creaky floors and spooky atmosphere.

One night, Madeline dies. They put her in a coffin and place her in a vault under the house. But the guy starts hearing noises again, and Roderick is acting even more freaked out than before.

Then, things take a really creepy turn. Madeline comes back from the dead! She's all gross and scary-looking, and she attacks Roderick. He's so scared that he dies of a heart attack.

The guy runs away as the whole house starts collapsing. It's like the house was somehow tied to Roderick and Madeline's lives, and now that they're gone, it's falling apart too.

It's a super spooky story that keeps you on the edge of your seat with all its eerie twists and turns.
